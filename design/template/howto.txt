Each file has certain strings that will be replaced with the appropriate code by the CMS system.
This is a list of those and and their class properties for decoration.  As you can see, I tried
leaving the theme engine open for a very relaxed design environment. 

mastertable.html:
	This is the master table layout. You can use either <table> or <div> but you will need to customize it appropriately.
	<javascript> injects the javascript needed for the CMS to function.
			class: (none)
	<banner> a div containing the banner
			Class: banner
	<linkframe> a div containing the links
			Class: linkframe
	<bodyframe>  a div containing the bodytext
			Class: bodyframe
			
banner.html
	This is where you'll place your HTML for displaying your banner.
	
bodyframe.html:
	This is just a file to add <body> to, unless you want to further design the inside of your body
	frame.
	<bodytext> is replaced with a div containing the file data from the CMS section or subsection.
			class: bodytext
			
linkframe.html:
	This is just a file to add <link> to, unless you want to further design the inside of your link gutter.
	<links> is div with your style that contains the appropriate <a href=> link and text it is then given this 
			div Class: links
			
link.html
	This is how each individual link will look you will need to include <link>
	<headlink> is an <a href=> that will display the appropriate caption per link.
			a and div Class: headlink (on hover: headhoverlink) 
			
menu.html:
	The menu is displayed relative to where the link is currently being displayed.  You can set 
	the options "before" or "after" in the options to determine if the menu begins drawing before
	your link, or after.  You will then want to use position:relative on your div containing your
	list and then adjust your x and y positions. Please take a look at the default theme to see how 
	this works.
	<menulist> is replaced with a <div> containing a list of <a href=> links 
			div class: menulist

menulink.html
	Defines how each link will look in your pop up menus.
	<menulink>
			a and div Class: menulink (on hover: menuhoverlink
